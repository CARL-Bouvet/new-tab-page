# new-tab-page
A *new tab page* for navigators.

## installation
For personal use only. That page can't be deployed in modern navigators as an *add on* or something like that. If you want to deploy it on your personal navigator, you need to compile it with Vue-CLI and serve the dist/ folder with http server or Apach htdocs. 

If you want a customized new tab page, you'would better see those links down below.
